# Cryptocurrency Market Data Analyzer Application
---
## Project Idea Explained:
Our goal with this project is to create an application that will allow you to input a crypto currency and by using a combination of market data as well as social and news sentiment analysis, make predictions as to its future performance. We will connect with market data APIs as well as News/Twitter APIs to gather data, perform analysis on, and forecast future action. 

Our project will contain the following components:

1. Data Gathering - We will collect data on cryptocurrency prices, trading volumes, market capitalization, and other relevant metrics using APIs such as coinmarketcap API as well as use keywords (ie. BTC, ETH, DOGE, XRP) to search and pull data from News APIs. 

2. Data Preprocessing: We will preprocess the data collected to ensure that it's in a format that's usable for analysis. This will involve transforming the data into a usable format, cleaning the data to remove any missing or inconsistent values, and normalizing the data so that it's consistent across different sources.

3. Data Analysis: We will perform various types of analysis on the data collected, such as time series analysis, trend analysis, and statistical analysis. We will accomplish this using tools such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib to perform these analyses in Python.

4. Data Visualization: Resulting analysis will create visualizations, such as line charts, bar charts, and heatmaps, to help users understand the data and insights generated from your analysis. The potential for running Monte Carlo simulations is also possible. 

5. User Interface: Though this project will not include a front end dashboard at this time, we will look to allow users to have the ability to input the cryptocurrencies they are interested in getting analyzed for the purpose of determining if they would be a good investment at this time.
